;"YPR196W";"";"861";"High";"";"Motifs from PBMs are very similar and are a variant monomeric GAL4-like motif.  Chose 861 as it passes the significance threshold against ChIP-chip data."
;"YPR186C";"PZF1";"1321";"Low";"";"This is a single literature site.  The protein almost certainly binds the site but it has not been demonstrated that this is an optimal binding site."

;"YPR086W";"SUA7";"1327";"Low";"Dubious";"This protein is not expected to bind DNA; it is supposed to bind DNA-bound TBP.  The TIRF-PBM data used to generate the motif included only 96 sequences."
;"YPR065W";"ROX1";"1396";"High";"";"About half the motifs have a typical ACAAT Sox core.  MITOMI motif 1396 has highest correspondence to both ChIP-chip and deletion expression data."
;"YPR054W";"SMK1";"1875";"Low";"Dubious";"I could not find any evidence that this protein binds directly to DNA.  There is only one motif derived from ChIP-chip but it bears little relationship to the data from which it was derived."
;"YPR052C";"NHP6A";"879";"Medium";"";"NHP6A and NHP6B are similar to the HMGB family, which is thought to lack sequence specificity.  However, the proteins do bend the DNA when they bind, and so may have some level of sequence specificity.  Essentially similar motifs were obtained for the two different proteins (in the same study) and the PBM motif for Nhp6A has a good correspondence to ChIP-chip data.  Give both Medium confidence."

;"YPR015C";"";"871";"High";"";"Only one motif available, from PBMs; resembles motof from CMR3 which is a paralogous gene (and nearly adjacent on the chromosome).  And, scores significantly against expression data."
;"YPR013C";"CMR3";"859";"High";"";"PBM motifs are very similar. No other supporting data, but it\'s a clean motif. Chose 859 because it most closely resembles motif from paralog YPR015c."

;"YPL139C";"UME1";"1143";"Low";"Dubious";"It is not clear that this is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein; it contains no DNA-binding domain and has no known in vitro sequence specificity.  The motif comes only from ChIP-chip.  But, it has a high P-value, and the motif has low similarity to other motifs, with the possible exception of Yox1.  But the function of the protein is very different from that of Yox1.  Tough call - leave as Dubious, but give Low confidence to motif 1143."
;"YPL133C";"RDS2";"757";"Medium";"";"All motifs contain CGG. PBM motif 2226 appears to be a monomeric version of literature motif 757. However, the paper that produced motif 757 did not demonstrate that this is an optimal binding site. Retain both motifs and give them a \"medium\" confidence."

Not much correspondence to expression however, hence Medium confidence.  ChIP-chip motif 910 does slightly better on expression but to me is not a credible MADS box binding site."
;"YPL089C";"RLM1";"1079";"Incorrect";"";"Likely represents Mcm1 binding site."
;"YPL075W";"GCR1";"2071";"High";"";"Gcr2 is not a DNA-binding protein.  SGD:  \"Gcr1p is a DNA-binding protein interacting with the consensus sequence CTTCC, whereas Gcr2p interacts with Gcr1p\".  But, ChIP-chip motif 606 is probably the best Gcr1 motif available (even though it came from Gcr2 ChIP)."
;"YPL049C";"DIG1";"0";"";"Dubious";"Not a TF - it binds Ste12; all the motifs are Ste12 motifs."
;"YPL038W";"MET31";"1370";"High";"";"Most motifs look similar.  MITOMI motif 1370 has highest overall correlation to ChIP-chip, OE, and deletion data."

The literature motif 756 consists of two back-to-back and slightly overlapping versions of the monomeric PBM motif. There is no evidence for direct binding in this specific spacing and orientation; however, the results of mutations in reporters indicate that both copies are necessary for induction in the mutant. Retain both motifs."

;"YOR372C";"NDD1";"0";"";"Dubious";"There is no evidence that this is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, either in vitro or in vivo or in its sequence.  The ChIP-chip motif that scores most highly is actually an MCM1 motif, which is consistent with the role of NDD1 as a \"transcriptional activator essential for nuclear division\"."

;"YOR358W";"HAP5";"695";"High";"";"Subunit of the heme-activated, glucose-repressed Hap2/3/4/5 CCAAT-binding complex - there should be a single motif for all four proteins, containing CCAAT.  ChIP-chip motif 695 resembles CCAATCA, and scores highly on ChIP-chip, OE, and deletion expression data."
;"YOR344C";"TYE7";"397";"High";"";"All studies except one get canonical HLH motif.  795 (PBM) is nearly tied for best ChIP-chip score with the best ChIP-chip motif. Still, ChIP motif 397 scores higher, and looks identical, but with fewer flanking empty positions."
;"YOR337W";"TEA1";"817";"Medium";"";"Three motifs, all from PBMs. Choose 817 because it has a more robust GAL4 \"CGG\" core. But there is no convincing corroborating data for either motif and they do not match each other."

;"YOR162C";"YRR1";"2245";"High";"";"Classic monomeric GAL4-class motif. PBM studies agree and score significantly on Harbison data. No other motifs have spacing/orientation except 11909958, but even the authors of this study note that \"Only half a dyad seems to be conserved in this consensus sequence\". 2245 scores highest in Harbison data."

;"YOR140W";"SFL1";"605";"Medium";"";"None of the motifs are highly related to each other.  But, most share a GAAG core and are otherwise A-rich.  The PBM motif 839 in particular is compatible with the putative binding sites that are mutated in PMID 17594096, and it scores well on ChIP-chip.  Other motifs may represent different multimerization configurations.  ChIP-chip motif 605 also scores well on ChIP-chip data, which is circular, but I will retain it for completeness."

;"YOR028C";"CIN5";"1349";"Medium";"";"Most motifs match the classic YAP motif.  This is the best in vitro motif (highest match to ChIP-chip) and it is different from the ChIP-based motifs - might reflect homo vs. heterodimer?"

;"YOL108C";"INO4";"713";"High";"";"Ino2/4 binds as a heterodimer, so there should just be one motif for the two proteins.  All motifs appear similar but none of them is derived from in vitro data.  Nonetheless most motifs match a classic E-box with some preference for flanking bases.  Motif 713 is derived from ChIP-chip; it is not the highest-scoring ChIP-chip motif but it is highest for OE and deletion expression."

Little literature on this protein.  1737 chosen because it is largely symmetric and has highest score for both stressed and unstressed Harbison data, also, higher GO score"
;"YOL028C";"YAP7";"1414";"High";"";"8-base bZIP core. Obtained by Mitomi, so this is a homodimer.  Higher correspondence to unstressed ChIP-chip data.  Little literature on this protein.  1414 chosen for higher ChIP-chip overall scores; plus, it is a palindrome as expected for a bZIP protein."
;"YNR063W";"";"804";"High";"";"Motifs from PBMs are virtually identical.  This is a monomeric GAL4-like motif.  804 agrees more with ChIP-chip data."

;"YNL103W";"MET4";"0";"";"";"My understanding is that Met4 is a modifier of the specificity of other proteins.  SGD states that it \"requires different combinations of the auxiliary factors Cbf1p, Met28p, Met31p and Met32p\".  ChIP-chip motifs 1023 and 1024 I believe are cofactor motifs; they are E-boxes.  ChIP-chip motif 689 is different and matches Met28 and Met32 motifs.  (CTGTGG core).  Met28 is a bZIP protein, and Met32 is a C2H2.  MITOMI motif for Met32 is TGTGG.  So this is the Met32 motif.

;"YAL051W";"OAF1";"2060";"Medium";"";"Motif 2060 has a strong resemblance to the literature motifs for the Oaf1-Pip2 dimer, and scores highly on both ChIP and expression data.  No in vitro support and it\'s kind of weak looking so Medium confidence."
;"TBP-TFIIB";"TBP-TFIIB";"1329";"Medium";"";"The TIRF-PBM data used to generate the motif included only 96 sequences; hence, medium confidence."
;"TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB";"TBP-TFIIA-TFIIB";"1330";"Medium";"";"The TIRF-PBM data used to generate the motif included only 96 sequences; hence, medium confidence."
;"TBP-TFIIA";"TBP-TFIIA";"1328";"Low";"";"The TIRF-PBM data used to generate the motif included only 96 sequences.  Also it is curious that there is no TATA sequence in the logo."

;"MATALPHA1-MCM1-dimer";"alpha1-MCM1-dimer";"1442";"Medium";"";"Not clear that motif is optimal."
;"MATA1-MATALPHA2-dimer";"a1-alpha2-dimer";"1436";"Medium";"";"Not clear that motif is optimal."
;"MATA1";"";"0";"";"";"Need to study literature more carefully and consult experts.but at first glance none of these motifs seems right"
;"MAL63";"";"136";"Medium";"";"This is an unconventional dimeric GAL4-class motif"
